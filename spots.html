        <p>New York City is notorious for being an extremely expensive place to live. A typical night at a pub or restaurant can easily reach hundreds of dollars. According to bizjournals.com 1 in 25 New Yorkers are millionaires, but it’s a safe bet
          that not many of those millionaires are college students enrolled in BMCC. But, fortunately for us many of those rich people love playing chess and regularly donate millions to chess organizations to allow the public to play for free. Some
          of NYC’s millionaires donate their money to hire staff and buy chess sets to set up free games in NYC, some of them go out of their way to spend millions on restructuring and building free chess sites. Everyone knows about Washington
          Square Park and Union Square, but this Zine will highlight two of the lesser known but equally important chess spots in NYC, and best of all… IT’S ALL FREE!.(Chess House pictured above)</p>
        <h3>Chess & Checkers House</h3>
        <p>In my opinion The Chess & Checkers House is the premiere chess club spot in NYC. The famous Bernard Baruch (Baruch College) donated his own funds to build The Chess & Checkers House in 1986. Located in the middle of central park, take the
          cobblestone steps up a couple flights and you’ll find yourself surrounded by stone chairs and tables under a wooded cabana. The tables are fitted with a chess board on top. You may bring your own chess set if you wish, you may also borrow
          a complete chess set for free from the office located in the middle of the playing field.</p>

    <h3>Bryant Park</h3>
    <p>The world’s most famous park has so much to offer. Bryant park is one of the most visited parks in the entire nation, the reason being its proximity to Times Square. Nearly every train in NYC stops at or near Bryant park.</p>
     <p>The New York City parks and recreations offers free chess boards, clocks, and pieces. They have over 20 to lend out at a time. The chess community here changes depending on the time of day. During the early morning hours around 10pm to 12pm you will find mostly
      older retired folks. They played the game for decades, and know every trick in the book. From 2pm to 4pm you get a mix of younger kids who attended the nearby schools. From 6pm to 12pm you will find the young professionals who get out of their
      office jobs nearby. The 25-30 crowd is a mix of expert players and novices alike.</p>
