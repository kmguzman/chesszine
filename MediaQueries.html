<p>Change the size of the screen and you should notice that Box One is orange up to 900 px and then it is light grey. This is even though there is a media query setting it to purple up to 600px width.</p>
<p>This happens because the color for max-width: 900px comes second and so it's what's followed for everything up to 900px. After that the box goes back to the light-grey background color defined in line 8. Try changing the colors for other boxes and adding more max-width rules to get a sense for how it works.</p>
